If you are renting gear for the first time, please read the [gear rental information](/rentals) in full.

Security deposits vary by individual item. The deposit amounts below are averages.

### Restricted Gear

Items highlighted in <span style="color: red">red</span> require a safety review and permission from the appropriate MITOC officer before you can rent them. You can get approval by emailing [mitoc-approval@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-approval@mit.edu) 24 hours ahead of time. Be sure to include exactly what restricted gear you want to check out, what dates you'll have it, how and where it will be used, and your level of experience with the activity.

### Financial aid

If you are an MIT student renting gear for a MITOC trip and this cost is prohibitive to your participation, please email [mitoc-owner@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu) to ask about this fee being waived. If you are a non-MIT student please feel free to email to ask about financial assistance options.

**IMPORTANT:** In order to better serve our community, we approve Alpine Touring and Splitboard equipment rental requests on a first-come, first serve basis. In your request, please let us know (1) what ski size you want, (2) what boot size you want; (3) the day you will be renting them out; and (4) the day you will return them. Ski rentals are restricted to a one week/weekend rental (requests for longer term may be granted on a case-by-case basis). You may rent approved AT setups at office hours only after you receive confirmation from the ski chairs. Please return all ski equipment togetherâ€”skis, boots, and skins--at the beginning of the next week.

AT boots sizes:

### Boats and Cabin Rentals

MITOC has a selection of flatwater and whitewater canoes, kayaks, and packrafts available for rental. To rent these, you must first attend a boathouse keyholder training. See the [boathouse page](/rentals/boathouse) for more information on boathouse rentals.

We own two [cabins in New Hampshire](/rentals/cabins) where MITOC members can stay. These also require keyholder training before you rent.
