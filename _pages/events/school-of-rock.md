## Overview

The MIT Outing Club regularly runs School of Rock (also known as the MITOC Rock Program), a mentor session dedicated to getting climbers outside on real rock. SoR currently runs in two tracks, sport climbing and trad climbing. The sport track is for climbers learning to lead bolted sport climbs, and the trad track is for those who want to follow and lead trad (traditional gear protected) climbs. Both tracks focus on developing technical competencies and mentor-mentee relationships through a series of weeknight technical review sessions and weekend trips.

Open only to [MIT Outing Club members](/join).

## Disclaimer
Climbing is an inherently dangerous sport, and no amount of instruction or precaution can fully eliminate the associated risks. MITOC is not a guiding service, and this program will not be led by certified instructors. Mentors in this program are members of the MITOC community who are volunteering to share their experience and knowledge with the rest of the community.
