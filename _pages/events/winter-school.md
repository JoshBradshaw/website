### Winter school 2021

Due to the current surge of cases locally and in accordance with [MIT's response to COVID-19](http://web.mit.edu/covid19/) and the various local travel orders, we will not be running any in-person event.

Having said that, get stoked: we have a plan for everyone to learn or brush up their **winter adventure skills**, get inspired by **speakers** with diverse and inspiring backgrounds, **raffle** cool prizes, and more!

This year, we'll hold 4 virtual lectures, every Thursday of IAP, from 7pm to 9pm (Eastern Time). In more details:
- Thursday January 7th: Safety in the winter outdoors (clothing, basic gear, eating, drinking, weather, etc.). Introduction to winter activities (hiking, ice climbing, skiing).
- Thursday January 14th: Guest lectures - Savannah Cummins (adventure photographer, climber) & Anna Pfaff (climber)
- Thursday January 21st: Guest lectures, to be announced soon
- Thursday January 28th: Guest lectures, to be announced soon

If you have any question, please feel free to contact [`ws-chair@mit.edu`](mailto:ws-chair@mit.edu).

Do you enjoy being outdoors but don't know what to do when the temperature drops? Do you live for summer but suffer in winter? Are you cooped up from November to March? Don't hide from the cold — celebrate winter! During IAP, participate in MIT Outing Club's Winter School, where you can have fun learning skills like cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, ice climbing and more. Winter School is MITOC's crash course in cold weather activities.

### What is Winter School?

Winter School is an annual IAP course presented by the members of MITOC. Its goal is to teach the skills one needs to enjoy outdoor sports in the winter. During the month of January, participants attend lectures every Tuesday and Thursday evening and spend time outdoors during the weekends. Trips are offered at various levels of intensity and include hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, back-country skiing, ice climbing, winter camping, orienteering, and mountaineering.

<!-- ### What is the format?

During IAP, we hold Lectures during the week on Tuesday and Thursday, and go on trips during the weekend.

#### Lectures

#### Trips

**Note: no trip will take place this year**

Outdoor trips are held every Saturday and Sunday, and often involve travel to New Hampshire's White Mountains. These trips include hiking, ice climbing, skiing, overnights, and fat biking. Gear ranging from ice axes to winter boots is available for rent at-cost.

### What is required to participate?

Since we're not running any in-person trip, a MITOC membership will not be required this year. But if you can afford it, **please consider keeping paying your dues to support MITOC!**


<!-- In order to participate you simply need to complete three things.

1.  Make sure you are a current [MITOC member](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/membership/)
2.  Make sure you have signed the [MITOC waiver](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/waiver/)
3.  Attend the two mandatory lectures:
    *   Tuesday January 7th 7pm-9pm MIT Room [Room 26-100](https://whereis.mit.edu?q=26-100)

    *   We'll give sign in instructions during lecture. -->

<!-- ### I'm going to miss one of the two mandatory lectures. May I still participate?

Unfortunately, there are no exceptions to the first week lecture attendance rule. Because very important safety information is covered, we require that all participants be present at the first two lectures. -->

### I have done Winter School in the past. May I participate again this year?

Yes, returning students are welcome to come learn more skills. Remember that the first two lectures are mandatory, even if you've attended them before.
