The Bunkhouse Project is an exciting proposal to upgrade the infrastructure at our Camelot site with the construction of the 50-person MITOC Bunkhouse in honor of Joris Naiman, a MITOC alum who dedicated his professional life to saving endangered wildlife species.

This upgrade to our site will greatly revitalize MITOC’s basecamp in the White Mountains Region of New Hampshire. The proposed Bunkhouse will greatly enhance the outdoors experience for MIT students, MIT staff, and family and friends by providing a modern, comfortable, highly-insulated, safe, and … sleeping quarters.

The bunkhouse project was kick-started in 2018 by the generous initial donation in the memory of Joris Naiman which has funded the project through the design phase. During the design phase, MITOC, Maclay Architects, and MIT Facilities worked in close collaboration to define a bunkhouse that meets all the modern Building Codes and Regulations while maintaining a rustic, minimalist, and eco-friendly design in line with MITOC’s heritage. After numerous meetings, discussions, and iterations, the club has settled on a design for a bunkhouse that will help MITOC fulfill its core mission of getting MIT students outdoors for the next 50+ years. 

With a plan in hand, the MIT Outing Club has decided to move forward with the Bunkhouse Project. The plan as of today is to spend 2022 fundraising with construction planned for 2023. With an estimated cost of $500,000, we need your help raising the funds to proceed with construction. If you are able, please consider donating to help ensure MITOC can fulfill its mission for the next generation of MITOCers.

On behalf of the MITOC community, we look forward to seeing you in the near future at the new MITOC Camelot bunkhouse.
